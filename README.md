## Simple VR train map

A simple web-app to show realtime data from Finnish trains. The idea for this is to be a clone for the original VR Trains on map with some additional functionality being added sometime in the future. You can currently view trains on the map with realtime (12s interval) rendering.

### Tech stack & data source

- Next.js as frontend framework
- TailwindCSS & Shadcn for UI design and elements
- Mapbox GL JS for map rendering
- Digitraffic GraphQL API as main data source for realtime train data

### TODO:

- Map marker pop up with further train data
- Timetables table
- Own backend API for gathering static data and managing it from admin panel
