## Simple VR train map

A simple web-app to show realtime data from Finnish trains. You can view trains on the map and see realtime data such as timetables and announcements regarding train transportation.

### Tech stack & data source

- Next.js as frontend framework
- TailwindCSS & Shadcn for UI design and elements
- Digitraffic GraphQL API as main data source for realtime train data

### TODO:

- Realtime map
- Different page for timetables
- Clickable card to view more specific train data from map, (Also a picture of the train?)
